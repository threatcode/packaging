title: "@project@ should get rid of Python 2 and use Python 3 only"
description: |
    Python 2.x will no longer be supported by their upstream developers in
    2020. Thus Debian developers are actively removing Python 2 support in
    Debian Testing with the goal of getting rid of Python 2 in Debian 11
    (bullseye). We must do the same as our packages relying on Python 2
    modules provided by Debian will start to break...
    
    @project@ depends on Python 2.x and needs to be reviewed. Applications
    have to switch to Python 3. Python modules have to stop providing packages
    for Python 2 (as soon as no other packages depend on the Python 2 version
    of the module).

    In any case, this work must be done in coordination with upstream. Tag the
    issue with ~Forwarded once you have opened an upstream issue requesting this.

    If the package can't be fixed currently, then tag the bug with ~Blocked and
    add the issues of the blocking packages as “Related issues”.
